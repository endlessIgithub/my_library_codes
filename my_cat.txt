import sys

for i in sys.argv[1:]:
    file = open(i, 'r+')
    print(file.read().strip())
    file.close()

It's your turn to code the software cat!

Create a program called my_cat which does the same thing as the system's cat command used in the command-line.

Your program should read the content of each files which are received as an argument to your software.
Unlike the real Cat command, you don't have to handle any options. :-)
